Since the difference between any two adjacent numbers in this row is not greater than $2n-2$,\nthen when the rook piece moves from the smallest number in this row to the largest number, it cannot pass through the squares in the bottom row, because to reach the bottom row, it needs to take at least $n-1$ steps,  \nand to return, it needs another $n-1 $ steps, and it still needs to spend one step for horizontal movement. This indicates that the rook piece does not pass through the squares in the bottom row when traversing all the numbers in the top row. Similarly, when the rook piece traverses all the numbers in the bottom row, it does not pass through the squares in the top row. This indicates that all the numbers in the top row are either all greater than or all less than all the numbers in the bottom row. Similarly, all the numbers in the leftmost column are either all greater than or all less than all the numbers in the rightmost column.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that all numbers in the leftmost column are greater than those in the rightmost column, and all numbers in the bottom row are greater than those in the top row. Now observe the number $A$ at the top left corner and the number $B$ at the bottom right corner. On one hand, when viewed by column, we have $A > B$, at the bottom right corner. On one hand, when viewed by column, we have A<B. Contradiction.\nTherefore, the answer to this problem is $2 \\times 2023- 1 = 4045$.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition"}}
