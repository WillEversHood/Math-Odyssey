Now taking $m=7$, we can find that the number of $k$-digit \"auspicious numbers\" is $P(k)=C^{6}_{k+5}$.\n\n2005 is the smallest \"auspicious number\" of the form $\\overline{2abc}$, and $P(1)=C^6_6=1$, $P(2)=C^7_6=7$, $P(3)=C^8_6=28$. For the four-digit \"auspicious numbers\" $\\overline{1abc}$, the number of such numbers satisfying $a+b+c=6$ is the number of non-negative integer solutions, which is $C^{6}_{6+3-1}=28$.\n\nBecause 2005 is the 1st+7th+28th+28th+1st=65th \"auspicious number\", i.e., $a_{65}=2005$, so $n=65$, $5n=325$.\n\n$P(4)=C^6_9=84$, $P(5)=C^{6}_{10}=210$, and $\\sum_{k=1}^6P(k)=330$.\n\nSo, the last six five-digit \"auspicious numbers\" from largest to smallest are: 70000,61000,\\\\\n60100,60010,60001,52000.\n\nHence, the 325th \"auspicious number\" is 52000, i.e., $a_{5n}=52000$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition"}}

To maximize the product of the three altitudes, we should minimize the product of the three sides. Since angle $\\mathrm{A}$ is fixed with respect to side $\\mathrm{BC}$, and the area of the triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A$, which is constant, we should maximize $\\sin A$, so that $bc$ is minimized. As shown in the diagram below, draw line $l$ parallel to $\\mathrm{BC}$ at a distance of 2 units. Then, draw the perpendicular from $\\mathrm{B}$ to $l$, intersecting $l$ at $\\mathrm{A}$. Construct the circumcircle $\\mathrm{O}$ of triangle $\\mathrm{ABC}$.

{"Problem_120": {"question": "In a number-guessing game, the host has prearranged a permutation of the numbers 1 to 100, and participants also need to provide a permutation of these 100 numbers.

If all 51 people fail to guess correctly, it implies that the numbers from 1 to 51 are all in the last 49 positions, which is clearly contradictory. For 50 people, the permutation arranged by the host can be constructed as follows: fill in numbers from 1 to 100 in the positions 1 to 100 successively, ensuring that each number differs from the guesses of the 50 participants (at least 50 different numbers). If, for any position $\\mathrm{k}$, it's not possible to do so, it implies that at least 50 numbers that could have been placed in position $\\mathrm{k}$ have already been placed elsewhere. Since any number not yet placed can be placed in at most 50 different positions (including position $\\mathrm{k}$), there will always be a number that can replace the one initially placed at position $\\mathrm{k}$.
